# The Vibe-to-Code Manifesto

We believe that the bottleneck in software creation is no longer syntax, but **clarity of intent**.
BridgeAgent exists to solve the "Translation Gap" between human creativity and machine execution.

## Our Core Beliefs

1. **Orchestration over Generation**
Generating code is easy. Orchestrating a system that builds exactly what was intended is hard. We focus on the latter.

2. **Context is King**
A single line of code without context is a liability. A line of code backed by a `SPEC.md` is an asset.

3. **Ambiguity is the Enemy**
If the "vibe" is unclear, we pause. We do not guess. We verify. It is better to ask one question now than to debug ten errors later.

4. **Humans Dream, Machines Build**
The human's role is to hold the vision (The Vibe). The machine's role is to handle the implementation details. We do not mix these responsibilities.

5. **Artifacts are Contracts**
We do not rely on chat history. We rely on tangible artifacts (`SPEC`, `TASK`, `REVIEW`). If it's not in the file, it doesn't exist.
